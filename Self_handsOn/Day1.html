        <h4>Some Thoughts : </h4>
        <p>1. All power is within you, You can do anything and everything</p>
        <p>2. In a conflict between the heart and the brain, follow your heart</p>
        <p>3. The great secret of true success, of true happiness, is this: the man or woman who asks for no return, the perfectly unselfish person, is the most successful.</p>
        <p>4. Neither seek nor avoid, take what comes.</p>
        <p>5. We are what our thoughts have made us, so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live, they travel far.</p>

            <p>Swami Vivekananda revealed to the world the true foundations of 
                India's unity as a nation. He taught how a nation with such a 
                vast diversity can be bound together by a feeling of humanity 
                and brother-hood. Vivekananda emphasized the points of drawbacks 
                of western culture and the contribution of India to overcome those.</p>
